## Project Description

The Digital Attendance System is a console-based C++ application designed to replace paper-based attendance taking in lecture halls.  

The system allows lecturers to:
- Register students
- Create lecture sessions
- Mark attendance (Present, Absent, Late)
- Generate attendance reports
- Store data using text files

The application runs offline on Windows and uses file handling (fstream) for data persistence.

- Mark attendance (P/A/L)
- Update attendance records

### 3. Reports and Summary
- Display attendance list for a session
- Show summary count of Present, Absent, and Late students

### 4. File Storage
- Saves students to `students.txt`
- Saves sessions to `session_<course>_<date>.txt`
- Data persists between program executions
